# Automated-Personality-Classification

## Data Mining Course Project

The automatic system analyzes the characteristics and behaviors of participants. And after observing the
past patterns of data classification, it predicts a personality type and stores its own patterns in a dataset.

This project idea can be summarized as follows:

- Store personality-related data in a database
- Collect associated characteristics for each user
- Extract relevant features from the text entered by the participant
- Examine and display the personality traits
- Interlink personality and user behavior (There can be varying degrees of behavior for a particular personality type.)
